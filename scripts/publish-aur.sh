# Usage: ./scripts/publish-aur.sh [vX.Y.Z]
#          default tag: v$(version from Cargo.toml)
#
# Each clone's own update-pkg.sh does the work: pkgctl version upgrade, .SRCINFO,
# a build, and a commit. It never pushes, so a release that stopped there left the
# AUR untouched while looking done. The version check below refuses to push a
# PKGBUILD that upgraded to something other than the tag being released, which is
# what happens when the GitHub release is not published yet.
